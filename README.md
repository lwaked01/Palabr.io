## Overview

This project is a simple and interactive word-guessing game built with a modern UI.
It recreates the familiar experience of daily word challenges, offering a clean interface, responsive layout, and intuitive user interactions.
## Deployment

## Features

🎨 Minimal and modern interface

🔤 Letter validation and color-coded feedback

📱 Responsive layout for desktop and mobile

⚡ Fast loading and smooth interactions

🌐 Live deployment with automatic updates

## How It Works

The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the hidden word.

After each guess, the letters provide feedback:

Green → correct letter, correct position

Yellow → correct letter, wrong position

Gray → letter not in the word

The game ends when the user guesses the word or runs out of attempts.
